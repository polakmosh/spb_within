<h2><u><center>DEBRIEFING:</center></u></h2>
  

<p><b><u>What is this study about?</u></b></p>

<p>This study examines how people resolve sentences with two meanings.</p>
<p>These types of ambiguous sentences happen all of the time during conversation.</p>
  
<hr>

<p><u><b>Imagine hearing the sentence below:</b></u></p>
<p>1a. Mary saw the man with <i>the binoculars</i>!<br>
1b. Mary saw the man with <i>the umbrella</i>!

<ul>
  <li><p>In the first sentence (1a), who has the binoculars? Mary? The man? It is completely ambiguous because Mary could use the binoculars to see the man, or she could've just seen the man that has the binoculars.</p></li>
  <li><p>In the second sentence (1b), it is relatively clear that the man has the umbrella. Mary definitely can't use an umbrella to see anything!</p></li></ul>
  
<p>We are interested in what interpretations people tend to have given the particular items in the sentence. If binoculars are used, is it more ambiguous? If an umbrella is used, is one interpretation more acceptable?</p>

<hr>

<p><b><u>How is the study conducted?</u></b></p>

<p>In this task, you listened to 36 sentences with various verbs and toys in them. These items sometimes could be used to perform the action (see = binoculars) or not (see = umbrella).</p>
<p> We are ultimately interested in how knowledge about what toys can be used for certain actions influences adults' comprehension of ambiguous sentences.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

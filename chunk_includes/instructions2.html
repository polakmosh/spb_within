BEFORE THE PAGE CONTENT
You might want to cache the images you are using in the experiment
if timings are going to be recorded during the experiment.
Below is an example of how to load an image without showing it.

<h2><strong>PRACTICE INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>You are about to do <em>6</em> practice trials. We will play three speeds: <em>original, medium, and fast</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <strong>first three trials</strong>, you will be able to play the sentences as<strong> many times</strong> as you need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <strong>last three trials</strong>, you will be&nbsp;<strong>unable</strong> to control the sentence presentation. This means that you will only hear the sentence once. This is how the rest of the experiment will go.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>At this time, please take the following steps:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>1. Please close all unnecessary browser windows and <strong>put away other distractions</strong>.&nbsp;<br /> 2. Make sure that your <strong>volume is on</strong> and loud enough to hear.<br /> 3. Please put your browser into <strong>full screen mode</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
